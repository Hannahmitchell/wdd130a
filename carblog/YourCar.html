               The Car Blog, I hope it's that 'You 
               should continue to educate yourself 
               about your assets', and that 'You can't 
               rely on your car if the car can't rely 
               on you'.</h3>

            <p>For example I used to have a 2007 Toyota 
                Prius, it had very high mileage and so 
                I was quickly informed that it may burn 
                through oil. I made a regular schedule of 
                checking the oil and added iol when needed. 
                This also let me know what oil my car would 
                need and especially with mileage. Because I 
                simply had to fill the oil fairly often, my 
                car's actual oil change schedule differed 
                from what a regular oil change schedule 
                should be.</p>

            <p>With understanding your car, its worldly value, 
                and its value to you, you may come across 
                issues with your car that just make the car 
                not worth fixing. I shared a bit more about 
                the things happening with my prius in my “your 
                research” section. But at some point even a 
                prius that will still run when it's low on all 
                liquids and with a long list of issues, you have 
                to know what worth fixing, an what makes the car 
                worth keeping.</p>
