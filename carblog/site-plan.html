      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>Hi my name is Hannah Mitchell, and I want to create a website to inspire and educate women a little bit. I want to educate others with basic knowledge about how to do simple maintenance on their cars. 
        After listening to my husband, a genuine car enthusiast,  share and educate me about my current car, the cars I drove in high school, and my dream cars, I learned how to maintain my own car! And became familiar  with how my car works uniquely from others, and most importantly by doing so I saved myself money and kept my old car lasting longer. I want all women, young people, and non automotive enthusiasts to begin or further their education on their cars to save money and their cars life span!

        <strong>Welcome to the Hannah Mitchell Car Blog!</strong>
        I know cars aren't for everyone and it seems easier to let the professionals take care of it, and that's just fine! My goal here is to share how to save yourself money and possibly a car in the long with basic maintenance tips. 
      </p>
      <p>Understanding what your car means to you:
        If there are two things you get out of The Car Blog, I hope it's that 'You should continue to educate yourself about your assets', and that 'You can't rely on your car if the car can't rely on you'.
        These are some very interesting thoughts I've had over the last couple of years listening to my husband's various groups of “car guys” he hung out with. There's obviously things about a car that make them more reliable than others on their own. But these car guys showed me that even your junk box car can be reliable as long as the junk box can rely on you to make sure its truly operable. And I swear this because I've seen and been in better running early 2000's beat up BMWs and Audis that run so much better than my mom's new 2018 Nissan Altima.

      <h3>Know Your Car</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Understanding what your car means to you:</strong>
        If there are two things you get out of The Car Blog, I hope it's that 'You should continue to educate yourself about your assets', and that 'You can't rely on your car if the car can't rely on you'.
      </p>
      <p>For example I used to have a 2007 Toyota Prius, it had very high mileage and so I was quickly informed that it may burn through oil. I made a regular schedule of checking the oil and added iol when needed. This also let me know what oil my car would need and especially with mileage. Because I simply had to fill the oil fairly often, my car's actual oil change schedule differed from what a regular oil change schedule should be. 
      </p>
      <p>With understanding your car, its worldly value, and its value to you, you may come across issues with your car that just make the car not worth fixing. I shared a bit more about the things happening with my prius in my “your research” section. But at some point even a prius that will still run when it's low on all liquids and with a long list of issues, you have to know what worth fixing, an what makes the car worth keeping.

      <h3>Your Research</h3>
      <p>
        If ain't me, who should your best friend be for learning about your car: 
	Whether you just got a car, have owned the car for  some years, or don't even yet own a car, educating yourself on something you use on a daily basis is very important, such as a car. Especially when we rely on it for various things. 
I want to preface that I am by no means professional and or a mechanic, and I know it sounds ridiculous to hear but google everything about your assets, in this situation, your car. You can find just about everything you need on google. And my testimony to this is that when I used to drive an old 2007 Toyota Prius with LOTS of miles on it, she used to have a good amount of very minor issues. Towards the end of my time owning the 2007 Prius, there began a bit of a list of not so minor issues building up. It very much seemed like it was beyond mine and my husband's ability to even fix and without thought we just took it to the Toyota dealership here in Vancouver. They were only able to pull codes for a bad water pump (one I actually had them replace a few months prior). Not to mention I already them that code was there when I took the car to them. I obviously wasn't going to pay for that to be done again, at least not yet. Now here's where my point stands, after no more than 10 minutes of googling the list of issues with the car, And I learned that the computer in the car was trying to throw every sign that the car should stop being driven because it had a failing brake system! 
	We would google small problems all the time and be able to figure it out on our own, but didn't even try with the big problem even google was the only place to tell me what's wrong with it. So I know they say don't diagnose yourself with google, but I'm going to tell you to diagnose your car with google!
      </p>
      <p>So with that …
        MAKE GOOGLE YOUR FRIEND!
