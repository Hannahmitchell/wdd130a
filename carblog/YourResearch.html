            <p>Whether you just got a car, have owned the 
                car for some years, or don't even yet own 
                a car, educating yourself on something you 
                use on a daily basis is very important, 
                such as a car. Especially when we rely on 
                it for various things. I want to preface 
                that I am by no means professional and or 
                a mechanic, and I know it sounds ridiculous 
                to hear but google everything about your 
                assets, in this situation, your car. You 
                can find just about everything you need on 
                google. And my testimony to this is that when 
                I used to drive an old 2007 Toyota Prius with 
                LOTS of miles on it, she used to have a good 
                amount of very minor issues. Towards the end 
                of my time owning the 2007 Prius, there began 
                a bit of a list of not so minor issues building 
                up. It very much seemed like it was beyond mine a
                nd my husband's ability to even fix and without 
                thought we just took it to the Toyota dealership 
                here in Vancouver. They were only able to pull 
                codes for a bad water pump (one I actually had 
                them replace a few months prior). Not to mention 
                I already them that code was there when I took the 
                car to them. I obviously wasn't going to pay for 
                that to be done again, at least not yet. Now here's 
                where my point stands, after no more than 10 minutes 
                of googling the list of issues with the car, And I 
                learned that the computer in the car was trying to 
                throw every sign that the car should stop being driven 
                because it had a failing brake system! We would google 
                small problems all the time and be able to 
                figure it out on our own, but didn't even 
                try with the big problem even google was the 
                only place to tell me what's wrong with it. 
                So I know they say don't diagnose yourself 
                with google, but I'm going to tell you to 
                diagnose your car with google!</p>
