                <h3>Hi my name is Hannah Mitchell 
                and welcome to the Car Blog!
               I want to create a website to 
               inspire and educate women a little 
               bit. I want to educate others with 
               basic knowledge about how to do simple 
               maintenance on their cars. After listening
                to my husband, a genuine car enthusiast, 
                share and educate me about my current car, 
                the cars I drove in high school, and my 
                dream cars, I learned how to maintain my 
                own car! And became familiar with how my 
                car works uniquely from others, and most 
                importantly by doing so I saved myself 
                money and kept my old car lasting longer. 
                I want all women, young people, and non 
                automotive enthusiasts to begin or further 
                their education on their cars to save money 
                and their cars life span!

            <p class="Home_paragraph_1">Understanding what your car means to you is 
                how you start to learn not only about your 
                car, but what money, time, or effort is worth 
                it to you and at what point is any issue worth 
                your time money or effort. If there are two 
                things you get out of The Car Blog, I hope it's 
                that 'You should continue to educate yourself 
                about your assets', and that 'You can't rely 
                on your car if the car can't rely on you'. 
                These are some very interesting thoughts I've 
                had over the last couple of years listening to 
                my husband's various groups of “car guys” he 
                hung out with. There's obviously things about 
                a car that make them more reliable than others 
                on their own. But these car guys showed me that 
                even your junk box car can be reliable as long 
                as the junk box can rely on you to make sure 
                it's truly operable. And I swear this because 
                I've seen and been in better running early 
                2000's beat up BMWs and Audis that run so 
                much better than my mom's new 2018 Nissan 
                Altima.</p>

            The goal for Car Blog is to help others start their 
            journey with learning how to maintain their car, 
            start saving money doing it on their own, and 
            potentially prolong the life of the car!
